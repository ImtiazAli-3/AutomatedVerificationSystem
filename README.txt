The project uses sophisticated algorithms for 
real-time comparison against existing listings on trustworthy platforms, indicating unverifiable 
products for manual verification, in contrast to manual authentication processes. The development 
of a responsive platform interface, a user-centric listing submission form, an effective authorisation 
system, and an admin dashboard for comprehensive site administration represent a few of the main 
goals
